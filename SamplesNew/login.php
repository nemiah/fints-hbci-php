/**
 * This function is key to how FinTS works in times of PSD2 regulations. Most actions like wire transfers, getting
 * statements and even logging in can require a TAN, but won't always. Whether a TAN is required depends on the kind of
 * action, when it was last executed, other parameters like the amount (of a wire transfer) or time span (of a statement
 * request) and generally the security concept of the particular bank. The TAN requirements may or may not be consistent
 * with the TAN that the same bank requires for the same action in the web-based online banking interface. Also, banks
 * may change these requirements over time, so just because your particular bank does not need a TAN for login today
 * does not mean that it stays that way.
 *
 * The TAN can be provided it many different ways. Each application that uses the phpFinTS library has to implement
 * its own way of asking users for a TAN, depending on its user interfaces. The implementation does not have to be in a
 * function like this, it can be inlined with the calling code, or live elsewhere. The TAN can be obtained while the
 * same PHP script is still running (i.e. handleTan() is a blocking function that only returns once the TAN is known),
 * but it is also possible to interrupt the PHP execution entirely while asking for the TAN.
 *
 * @param \Fhp\BaseAction $action Some action that requires a TAN.
 * @throws \Fhp\CurlException
 * @throws \Fhp\Protocol\ServerException
